### 2. Possible features
- filter by zip codes
- Search by city/states/
- Find dogs in x km radius

### 3. Finding dogs in x distance radius
   1. using geolocation api to find current coordinates
   2. find bounding box coordinates (getBoundingBox(lat, lon, radiusKm = 5))
   3. using location/search to find zip codes
   4. use zip codes as filter in dogs/search to find dogs
